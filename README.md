# Network-Scanner
Builted a compact python-based network scanner for discovering live hosts and open ports on the local network.

# Features
- my project is able to do a ping sweep to discover live hosts
- do a TCP Port scan for common ports
  
# Why I Built this
built this tool to understand how they test authorisation on networks and not to do anyhting illegal with it as well as understand how connectivity on networks can be evalutated using ping sweep and checking that ports are available using TCP ports scanning.

# Tech Stack
- python ( VsCode IDE )
