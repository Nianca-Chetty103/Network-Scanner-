# Network-Scanner
Builted a compact python-based network scanner for discovering live hosts and open ports on the local network, not for illegal purposes but for education.

## Process 
- imported the important libraries needed run commands like ping and  TCP connection. 
- created functions for ping which allows the host device to check if the device with the certain IP address is active on the network or not.
- generated a range for the IP addresses in the network to exist.
- created function for the TCP port scanner which allows you to check which ports are available or used.
- allowed it generate results and save it.

## Features ✨
- able to do a ping sweep to discover live hosts
- do a TCP Port scan for common ports

## Problems ❔❔
- Having Unidentified devices on your network.
- Open ports and vulnerabilities - unmonitored ports can give hackers easy access to systems.
- manual scanning takes time.
- network blockage and mismanagement - able to optimize the network efficiently.

## How does this help the community / people 🤔
- detects the all devices on the network.
- montioring almost immediately / real-time.
- helps users be aware of what weaknesses / threats  the network is facing.
- able to having scanning done on the ports too.
  
## Why I learnt
- explore and expand my knowledge on building scanners for networks.
- expand my coding skills using python.
- ping sweep and how check port availability using TCP port scanning.
  
## Tech Stack 💻
- python
