# Network-Scanner
Builted a compact python-based network scanner for discovering live hosts and open ports on the local network.

## Features ✨
- my project is able to do a ping sweep to discover live hosts
- do a TCP Port scan for common ports

## Problems ❔❔
- Having Unidentified devices on your network.
- Open ports and vulnerabilities - unmonitored ports can give hackers easy access to systems.
- manual scanning takes time.
- network blockage and mismanagement - able to optimize the network efficiently.

## Solutions 🤔
- detects the all devices on the network.
- montioring almost immediately /real-time.
- helps users be aware of what weaknesses /threats  the network is facing.
- able to having scnning done on the ports too.
  
## Why I Built this
built this tool to understand how they test authorisation on networks and not to do anyhting illegal with it as well as understand how connectivity on networks can be evalutated using ping sweep and checking that ports are available using TCP ports scanning.

## Tech Stack 
- python
